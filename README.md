## Description

A budget tracker that allows users to keep track of the incoming and outgoing cash flow. Two input fields are available for each transaction as a name and an amount; users select whether these funds are added (credit) or subtracted (debit) from their account. Furthermore a chart displays the change over time by tracking the total amount in the account with each transaction. Transactions are recorded by the day in which they are incurred.
